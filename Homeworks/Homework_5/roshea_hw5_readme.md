# Instructions
For normal plot creation the code can be run as is and should produce a circular plot in 2D with 2000 points. It will also produce 6 subplots on a single plot of the joint torques over time. 
- In order to change the number of points used change the value of num_steps. Values below 500 will likely cause a visibly incomplete circle
- Normal running of the code will print the symbolic gravity matrix as well as the end effector position over time
