# ENPM662 HW 1

### Requirements:
- Python 3
- numpy
- sympy
- math

### Instructions
Each of the 3 scripts in the code folder can just be run as is without any modification using python3 <script_name.py>. For problem 1 this will generate a graph of the bike's trajectory. The initial conditions for this can be changed in the main function of the code to alter the trajectory of the bike. For problem 2 both can be run to print out the answer to the console. For problem 2 part 1 this will be the equations for to calculate the position and velocity of the end effector. Problem 2 part 2 will print out the forward velocity kinematics matrix (maps joint states to end effector state), the inverse velocity kinematics matrix (maps end effector state to joint states), and the subsequent equations for calculating the velocity of theta_1, L1, and theta_3 based on the end effector velocities.
